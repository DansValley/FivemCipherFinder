# [CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT] FivemCipherRemover (v1.0.0)
This is a Fivem Cipher remover for those that don't want Ciphers in their scripts :D

The idea behind these scripts are to remove a Cipher or more. Currently, there is it only in Python available, but I will soon add the C++ variant.

Desc:
The script will walk through your Servers directory's and scan for as example `\x41\x42\x43`. When it found something.

## Languages 
Planed are Python (Currently in development) and C++ (Not started)


## Install instructions for Python
Py-Version: 3.10 and above

Clone or Download the latest release and unpack it.

The `main.py` is your entry point, you can run it with `python3.10 main.py <Your Path>`
The script with the Ciphers getting logged in a File (`CipherLog.txt`) that gets created.
